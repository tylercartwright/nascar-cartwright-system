# The Cartwright System
*An alternate Playoffs format for the NASCAR Cup Series.*

## Differences
**1. During the regular season, a win does not secure a spot in the Playoffs.**

The 16 drivers that advance are #1-#16 in the points standings at the end of the regular season. During the Playoffs, a win will still secure a driver's spot in the next round. The endgoal is to crown a deserving Champion, and that driver is going to be well within the top 16 in points.

**2. #1-#8 in the points standings at the end of the regular season are locked into the Round of 12; they cannot be eliminated in the Round of 16.**

Since the Playoffs are made up of 10 races and the regular season is made up of 26, the regular season is a more reliable metric for average performance over a period of time. In the spirit of the regular season champion receiving a comfortable cushion of 15 bonus playoff points to help them advance once the Playoffs begin, the top 8 get some additional security to make a deep Playoffs run.

**3. The Round of 16 is now one race; the Round of 4 is now three races.**

The Round of 16 becomes a single elimination race where, of the eight drivers who are not locked in, four advance and four are eliminated. The drivers who performed well up to this point get some extra security that cannot be jeopardized by one bad race; realistically, a deserving Champion should already be in the top 8 at this point and the only ones who could possibly get eliminated by one bad race would already be a long shot for the Championship. Ideally, this race would be a high-skill track such as Darlington, which usually gets the first Playoffs race on the calendar anyway.

**4. Additional points are awarded.**

The Playoffs format demonstrates that NASCAR clearly values winning; for a Playoffs format to go off the points only, it's important to make sure that these wins grant a significant amount of points.

Winning a race is now worth 50 points rather than 40. With P2 earning 37, this becomes a significant gap that serves to reward drivers who win.

Additionally, points are awarded for the following achievements:
* 25 points - Granted the first time a driver wins a race in the regular season.
* 10 points - Granted the first time a driver wins a pole in the regular season.
* 10 points - Granted the first time a driver wins a stage in the regular season.
* 5 points - Granted the first time a driver leads the most laps of a race in the regular season.
* 5 points - Granted any time a driver wins a pole.
* 5 points - Granted any time a driver leads the most laps in a race.
* 1 point - Granted any time a driver leads the most laps in a stage.

## What's wrong with the Playoffs?
After the 2024 NASCAR Cup Race at Michigan, only two races remained in the regular season and the field was looking well-defined. The past week at Richmond, Austin Dillon came from 32nd in the standings to controversially win the race and lock himself in, only to be penalized and keep his win but lose his spot in the playoffs; nonetheless, this win got people talking about the absurdity of a driver this far back in the standings potentially advancing to the Round of 16, something he unquestionably would have achieved had there not been a late race restart to stack the field back up when he was running well ahead of anyone else.

This left 12 drivers locked in on wins, with four spots reserved for winless drivers with the most points. These spots were occupied by Martin Truex Jr, Ty Gibbs, Chris Buescher, and Ross Chastain. Ross Chastain was in a particularly precarious situation, sitting exactly 1 point ahead of Bubba Wallace; Buescher wasn't safe either, with only a 15 point advantage over Chastain. All signs suggested an exciting battle for points to decide the last spot.

A week later, the drivers headed down to the Coke Zero Sugar 400 at Daytona International Speedway. The points battle was intense; Buescher had a strong Stage 1, pulling well ahead of Chastain and Wallace; Wallace picked up a point in Stage 2 and tied Chastain. Then, an upset. Harrison Burton, pushed by Parker Retzlaff, got to the lead for the first time in the entire race on the very last lap. He raced side-by-side with Kyle Busch, both on the outside looking in, but ultimately Burton would throw two blocks on Kyle Busch and score his first ever win. It was exciting, romantic, storybook stuff... until the thrill wore off and everyone realized what this meant for the Playoffs.

Harrison Burton had been 34th in the standings. This wasn't just lower than Austin Dillon had been. This was dead last. A driver and team that had performed so poorly that they were behind literally everyone else in the running had, in a single lap of a single race, secured a spot in the Round of 16, pushing out one yet-undecided driver who had earned more than twice as many points as he had. Buescher had increased his lead and Wallace finished well enough that he put himself 6 points ahead of Chastain, but the points race was still tight. Only now, there was one less spot, and the final one was securely held by Buescher.

Darlington marked the end of the regular season this year. There were four things that could happen to the Playoffs picture tonight: Buescher could maintain his points lead and make the Playoffs, Wallace could make up 21 points and steal Buescher's spot, Chastain could make up 27 points and pass both Buescher and Wallace, or a completely new winner could swoop in and further squash an exciting battle between drivers who had been performing admirably all season. With 26 laps to go, Chastain would be restarting up front after staying out in a futile effort to hold onto the lead. On the back stretch, Chase Briscoe in fourth would take it three-wide and pick up three spots; he'd hold out through another restart and fend off Kyle Busch's advance on the last lap, winning his way into the playoffs from 18th in the standings. Buescher, Wallace, and Chastain were all out; the points battle was out the window. Couple that with Suarez in 17th and Cindric in 19th, we now had four drivers outside the top 16 in points who were guaranteed to finish at least 16th in the standings no matter what happened for the rest of the season.

And what did this mean for the fans? It was exciting to see so many underdogs win, especially from dead last in the standings, but would things be any different if these drivers weren't locked into the playoffs because of it? There would be less resentment at these drivers (who were just doing what they were supposed to do) but otherwise, no, these finishes would still be exciting. That's not the Playoffs. That's just racing.

## What do the Playoffs accomplish?
The NASCAR Playoffs system is designed to reward winning and mimic other major professional sports formats popular in the US. Historically, NASCAR used a standard points system similar to most motorsports, where consistent is the best thing a driver can be. Winning 10 times is great, but not if that same driver is wrecking out of 20 races in that same season. The person who wins 6 times and finishes 2nd through 5th every other week is admittedly probably a better driver. This meant that a lot of the time, drivers would simply have a "good points day," where they bring a good car to the track, keep it off the wall, and finish 4th. While there's nothing wrong with a driver having an uneventful day, NASCAR was well aware that its most beloved moments rarely came from a car that just didn't really get tangled up with anyone else. They wanted 'Game 7' moments, not safe but dominant performances.

In many regards, NASCAR succeeded. The drivers race more aggressively, the field consistently has more unique winners than ever, and the highlight reel is full of intense moments from drivers who know they have to either perform now or come back next year. It is this format that gave the world the legendary Hail Melon, where Ross Chastain chose to run his car into the wall and gas it up instead of braking in the last turn of Martinsville with everyone else, shredding the side of his car but setting a track record and picking up just enough spots to transfer into the final round of the Playoffs; Ross wouldn't do this for a couple of points, but he would if it's his only chance at a Championship. And it was.

Where NASCAR went wrong is that this format devalues the Championship. The driver who was the best all year in decades past could finish 5th or 6th because the races they won weren't at the right time. A driver who is very good at four specific tracks could perform well there only and win their way all the way to the Championship 4 and beyond if the tracks chosen for each round line up the right way. And perhaps most regrettably, the Championship round is one race where four drivers come in with the same amount of points and simply have to finish ahead of the other three to secure the Championship. If you're going to have engine trouble once in the season, you'd better hope it's not here, because everything that came before is out the window.

The best driver can still win, of course. Kyle Larson was the regular season champion in 2021. He went on to win 10 races in one of the most dominant seasons in modern NASCAR history. But despite clearly being obviously the most deserving driver from pretty much the first few weeks of the season, Larson's Championship run nearly fell short. It was only thanks to a couple of exceptional pit stops in the final race at Phoenix that Larson was able to pick up enough spots to get ahead of Martin Truex Jr.

The Playoffs succeed in enhancing the drama, which is entertaining to the fans, but they fail to adequately measure much of anything. How do we know who the Champion is? Well, they had a bunch of points and won that one race at Phoenix so they must be, right?

## What's the right approach?
To most appropriately address the Playoffs format's shortcomings, we cannot simply throw the format out and return to the points format. It reliably achieves excitement that the standard points system of the Winston Cup years was not guaranteed to. So instead, it may be better to address those shortcomings without butchering the format.

The Cartwright System is an alternative Playoffs format designed with this goal in mind.
